# gojs-angular-basic

### By Northwoods Software for [GoJS 2.1](https://gojs.net)

This project provides a basic example of using GoJS in an Angular app.
Check out the [Intro page on using GoJS with Angular](https://gojs.net/latest/intro/angular.html) for more information.

It makes use of the [gojs-angular](https://github.com/NorthwoodsSoftware/gojs-angular) package to handle some boilerplate for setting up Diagram, Palette and Overview components.

When running the sample, try moving around nodes, adding / deleting nodes, editing text in the inspector, relinking, undoing (Ctrl-Z), etc. within the diagram
and you'll notice the changes are reflected in app-level data. You'll also notice that changes
made in the inspector are reflected in the diagram.
